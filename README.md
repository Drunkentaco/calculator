Have finished the odin project fundation course, so I'll use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS make this calculator.

Man, I seriously made this A LOT more complicated at my first go! I need to remember that =+ and =- operators exist!
I was stuck on this project for soo long, but after a vacation, I realized that I didn't have make divs for EVERY digits!

Once I redo all my coding with =+ operators for the display, things was a lot easier :D

Lesson learned!
